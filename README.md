Hello, this is my attempt at the coding interview for junior full stack developer at erento. 

To run the solution you should open the root folder in VS Code.

Once you have the root folder open, open two separate terminals. 

From the terminal, navigate to the frontend folder:

`cd interview-frontend`

Run the following command to istall the node packages for the frontend:

`npm install`

Repeat the same steps for the backend:

`cd interview-backend`

`npm install`

You should have the fronend and backend ready to be launched.

To start the frontend, navigate to the frontend folder from the terminal:

`cd interview-frontend`

Then run the follwing command to start the frontend app:

`npm start`

To start the backend, navigate to the backend folder from the terminal:

`cd interview-backend`

Then run the following command to start the backend app:

`npm start`

To run the app in development mode use the dev script:

`npm run start:dev`

This will launch the app in development mode, reloading the app everytime code changes are applied.
